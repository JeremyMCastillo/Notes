# What are Design Systems
Design systems are a combination of the following. Each of the following points are not design systems themselves, but only together do they form a design system. 
## Coponents 
Individual pieces that are used to build up a website or app. A standardized collection of elements that can be drawn upon. Using components keeps things looking cohesive and prevents you from reinventing the wheel. 
## Guidance
Directives for using the components correctly. Without proper guidance, it's possible to have beautiful components used improperly. 
## Reference Site
A singular location that houses the components and guidance. Essentially, the style guide. 
# Why Use a Design System
## Saves Time
If you have a design system, you can pull from a store of components and idealogy when developing. You don't need to reinvent the wheel and remake decisions. 
## Adds Consitency
Reduces confusion, build once and propogate the entire system. Collaboration becomes easier when a Design System is in place. It becomes a shared refernece. Allows for easier communication within the team. With a design system, when someone says "Let's use the drop down here." there is no ambiguity in what they mean.

# Creating Your Own Design System
## Universal Patterns
Components that all applications need: textd, forms, menus, buttons. These are a good starting point to start establishing the system. 
## Specific Patterns
Patterns that set your application apart from others. How do you want the feel of your application to differ from others? For [[jeremycastillo.net]] I wanted the website to feel professional and comfortable to look at. For that reason, my Design System would include my natural tone color palette. 
# Questions 
1. How do you practically enforce a Design System? What is to stop a developer from overlooking, ignoring, or misunderstanding the system? Sure the argument could be made that a disregarded system needs improvement, but what are the preventative measures a designer could put into place to avoid deviations from the system? 
	1. Possibly the key to making sure a Design System is properly implemented is by making it as simple and concise as possible. 
	2. A digital Design System with searchability probably has a much better chance of survival than one in print. 
2. Is it better to come up with the system all at once before the project, or as you develop and run into problems?
