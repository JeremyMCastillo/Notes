## 1. Atoms
The base construction element for your designs. These are generally the raw HTML elements on their own. These could be form inputs, buttons, paragraph sections, but each entity is designed on their own. 

## 2. Molecules
When a few atoms are combined to form a functional entity, a molecule is formed. An example would be an input label, an input field, and a submit button.
