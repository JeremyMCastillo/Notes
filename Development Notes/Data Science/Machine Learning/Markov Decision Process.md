# Markov Decision Process Rules

$$(S, A, P_{\alpha}, R_{\alpha})$$
1. $S$ represents a set of states. 
2. $A$ represents a set of actions called the [[Action Space]]. 
3. $P_{\alpha}(s,s')$ is a function that represents the probability that the action $\alpha$ will lead from state $s$ to state $s'$. 
4. $R_{\alpha}$ is the reward received after transitioning to state $s'$.
