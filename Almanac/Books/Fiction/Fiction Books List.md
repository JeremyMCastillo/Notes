I loved all of the references to video games and music and movies. It felt a lot like the anime One Piece.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The book was much better than the movie, giving a much more detailed description of the children's abilities and their relationships.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Miss Peregrine's: Hollow City              | Ransom Riggs                 | February 2017    | 02/26/17       | Gives the events following the first book, the children with abilities are being hunted.                                                                                                             | Turned out being much better written than the first book. I enjoyed that the setting was expanded to more than just the island where the children were first found.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The poetic writing gave Buck an unforgettable personality. This book gave me the same feels as did the movie “Into the Wild”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I was surprised at the adventure aspect of the book, I've never read that from Poe.

Some of the best mystery I've read so far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

It was much more cinematic than the first two, and also much more exciting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

His detail in describing feeling and expanding the story inward into the character's thoughts and feelings makes the outward adventure more captivating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

There are only a few extra details contained within the book that are not present in the movie. The movie only added the subplot about the game maker. The story is very well written and very interesting, I'm glad that the movie follows it so closely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

It was nice being able to experience it as new. The book is good, but not very “big.” It's as if the plot is suited for an episode of a cartoon, rather than a book.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The movie was already incredibly touching, but the book made it so much more real.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Martin          | 04/30/17         | 06/18/17       | The first in a series of five books that tells the story of several great kingdoms and the battles that take place between them.                                                                     | The best thing about this books was that even though it was so long, it was never boring. The thing I appreciated most about these stories was that they were full of reality. Nothing seemed to be done for purpose of plot or moral. Everything that happens seems to be how things would happen if they were taking place in real life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| The Purloined Letter                       | Edgar Allan Poe              | 06/18/17         | 06/19/17       | A mystery short story where a police officer asks the help of a genius detective. He is asked to find a letter that was stolen.                                                                      | This was a very good short detective story, and one of the easier ones to read by Poe. I liked the theme that the mystery was hard to solve because the letter was hidden directly in plain view. It's amazing to think about how these stories could have influenced the Sherlock Holmes stories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The main problem with this book is that each chapter is left off with a cliff hanger and it starts to get repetitive. However, I did think that it was more suspenseful and well written. I wish I had read this book before I saw the movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Artemis finds his dad but has to help the people first.                                                                                                  | A very good sequel, much more grand than the first. My favorite thing about these books is that they read like comic books, and while the subject matter of the story is a little childish, Colfer's writing style makes you lose yourself in it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

I like the turn his stories are starting to take, from the detective novels to interesting short stories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

As always, my favorite thing about his writing is just the sheer amazing attention to detail that he shows. It's not as if he's over describing a setting or a character. His detail is in the relationships and small actions between characters.

It really is a book about true love, but more like the love between parent and child, as opposed to man and woman.

If this story is any indication of the rest of the stories, I'll be very excited to get to them all. So far the book is fantastic.

At first I didn't understand why he was so crude and cynical. Reading Ham on Rye completely put things into perspective. I now understand why he is the way that he is, and especially so because I knew people almost exactly like him in middle and high school. It was really interesting hearing the story from the degenerate's side. It made me really think about some of the people I knew back and then and it made me feel sorry for them. My favorite part of the book was how the language evolved throughout the story. It was as if his writing matured with the character. I now look forward to reading other works by him, including his poetry. |

The only thing I could think about during the whole book was just how well it was written. I definitely understand why this is one of the most popular mystery novels out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| A Song of Ice and Fire: A Clash of Kings   | George R. R. Martin          | 02/01/18         | 02/22/18       | The second book in the Song of Ice and Fire series. This story deals more with the wars between several self claimed kings. Further developing the plot between several prominent houses.            | I definitely liked this one less than the first one, but I still think it was good. I mentioned in the first book I appreciated that there was a reality to the story, as if the characters truly acted as they would if they were really living. This book had a bit less of that. The characters' actions in this story were a bit more unbelievable, but much more cinematic. There was more magic in this book, which also broke some of the immersion, but still the story was very exciting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Moon-Face                                  | Jack London                  | 02/23/18         | 02/23/18       | One guy kills another guy that annoys him.                                                                                                                                                           | This was a good departure from Jack London's normal work. I can't tell if it was still centered around dogs because of the collection it's in, or because Jack London always writes about dogs. Either way the story was good and suspenseful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The premise has become a cliché, but it was still interesting enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The story seems very familiar, I'm sure I've heard it, or a version of it before. Even though it was familiar, I still got a nice sense of excitement from it. My favorite part was the wrap up at the end. The entire story challenges you to try and work out what is happening on your own, and by the end, the final reveal is just so satisfying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

These aren't my favorite type of stories. Plus they're longer which makes them more boring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Too much weird stuff happens and it's just all around silly. I do appreciate, however, how much these princess stories feel slightly like modern/popular princess fairy tales, even though they contain a lot of annoying nonsense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Life of Pi                                 | Yann Martel                  | 02/27/18         | 03/22/18       | A religious child survives a sinking ship with a tiger.                                                                                                                                              | The interesting thing about this book is that I had some expectation of the weight of it since I had already seen the movie. The movie itself hit me so hard that I thought I was prepared for the impact of the book, but this book still took me by surprise. The movie is pretty close in terms of plot and content but there's no way to portray the thoughts and feelings described in the book. It of course makes you think about the nature of religion but it does it in a really beautiful way. The revelation also comes on so suddenly at the end of the story that the impact is that much harder. I can only imagine the impact the book would have, had I caught all of the many layers of symbolism.                                                                                   |

It read like a comic book. I didn't like it quite as much as Artemis Fowl but it was still entertaining. I feel like there were some plot holes, but overall it was a good story. I look forward to seeing the movie adaptation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Rogue Squadron led by Wedge Antilles deals with the remnants of the galactic empire.                                                                       | I think this book definitely lived up to the hype. I'm just disappointed that this story is not considered canon anymore. It was more of a military story than anything. The writing style was sometimes hard to follow. It was long periods of conversation peppered by intense action sequences. It definitely carried the Star Wars spirit, and I'm very excited to continue the series.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

However it is up to a single boy to keep all of the feelings and memories for the community. | An incredibly unexpected amazing book. The kind of story that truly gives you a different perspective on life. It also does so in such a respectable, simple way. Definitely in one of my top five favorite books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

I loved the extra amount of commentary I was able to get from this format. There were some pretty heavy messages from this book, which isn't a surprise from a Spider Man story. Spider Man's morals and flaws make him a great super hero. This book definitely helped solidify him as my favorite Marvel hero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
