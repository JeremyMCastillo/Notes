# 52/17 rule 
## How 
Similar to pomodoro. Work for 52 minutes then take 17 minute break. Apparently the exact amount of time your brain needs to focus and rest. Creates bigger intervals of productive work. Set 52 min timer and work without stopping. Then do something entertaining for 17 minutes. 
## Disadvantages 
Classic pomodoro may work for other people. 52/17 works for people who take longer to get into things.
