# Why do we lose motivation? 
We lost motivation because with each step we take, we are unsure if that step is moving us closer or further away from our goals. We don't know if we're spending too many days wasting our time. We're never going to get where we want to go. We have a lack of clarity and we need to know what it is we want to do and what we need to do to achieve it. 
# When you're lost
When you find yourself lost, you need to stop and realize that you're lost and figure out where you need to go. 

Don't try to power through it. Find your clarity once again.  

If you don't have motivation, admit that you don't know where you are or where you're going.
