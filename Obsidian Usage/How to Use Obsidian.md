# This is Obsidian.
It seems like the main purpose of Obsidian is [[Linking]] your thoughts to other thoughts. By using double square brackets you can create a link between notes. A link between thoughts. 

This type of stream of consciousness thinking is a new concept to [[Me]] and it seems pretty exciting. I'd like to see how this collection of thoughts grows over time. It could be the new way that I Journal. 

# Dynamic Linking
The beset thing about [[Linking]] in Obsidian is that you don't have to stop and create another document on the spot when you want to link to it. All you have to do is create the link, and the note is not created until you go back and click on the link. If you click the link, the note is created. If you don't,  it isn't, you can move on with your life. 

# Views
It seems like there are several helpful views that you can use in Obsidian, the main one is the edit window where you can type Markdown. Another tab view gives you links and references from within your current note, and another view shows you a rendered markdown page. It seems like there are more [[Plugins]] and views to take advantage of, I'm interested to discover all of the options.
