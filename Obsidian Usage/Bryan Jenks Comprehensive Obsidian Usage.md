# Note Taking Rules
## Link always 
Note taking is most important when you can link your thoughts and ideas together. 
## Resist Copy Paste
The benefit of an analog note taking system like [[Zettelkasten]] is that writing notes by hand takes a lot of effort. Taking notes digitally has the opposite problem of being to easy to take notes or to copy paste. Copy paste in particular reduces the usefullness and quality of your notes.
