# Overview
Bryan Jenks is a programmer and expert note-taker that uses Obsidian.md to organize his thoughts. He uses concepts of [[Zettelkasten]] and [[Evergreen Notes]] to build is interconnected network of thoughts and notes. 

It's not about "How do I search for this data" it's about "How am I going to stumble upon this data?" which is achieved through heavy linking. 
# Note Taking Rules
## Link always 
Note taking is most important when you can link your thoughts and ideas together. 
## Resist Copy Paste
The benefit of an analog note taking system like [[Zettelkasten]] is that writing notes by hand takes a lot of effort. Taking notes digitally has the opposite problem of being to easy to take notes or to copy paste. Copy paste in particular reduces the usefullness and quality of your notes.

## Reading a book example
Read a book and mark down page when you read something interesting, and write your own notes about it. Finish the whole book by repeating this method. 

Make a "second pass" after reading the book by going through your notes. Expand on most interesting ideas by turning them into their own links/posts. 

In those specific links and posts, continue expanding on the idea by further linking other posts and ideas.
