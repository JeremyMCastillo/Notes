# Definition
A Map of Content is a way to organize notes by _Proximity_. Groups of like topics are kept together in a Table of Contents like structure. Each MOC is related to one specific major topic. Within the MOC there can be subtopics, with specific notes related to the subtopic. This method of organization leads to High Order notes that help to identify and build relationships.
