Describing a picture down to the last feature is overkill.

Use context to help decide what should be explained. For example, if the article title explains how two hotels are in a legal battle, a picture of the hotels can just have "The two hotel fronts" as the alt text.

Think of how technical documents use text next to "Figures" to explain the significance of the image.

Use alt text to carry emotion. You can use them to make your page more enjoyable to read.
