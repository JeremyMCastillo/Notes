Girders or beams can support joists. Sometimes made of gropued dimensioned lumber. LVL also available. Meant to span distnaces.

Walls are built with studs stood on ends on top of plate. 2x4 or 2x6. 16-24 OC. Plate is not treated, sits on top of subfloor. Bottom plate and top plate both. Top plates are double plated. Walls built on ground and stood up. Doors and windows get special framing.

Headers are special types of framing, almost serve as girders. Transfers weights out to the edges of the opening. Creates a safe hollow space. Could also be made of lvl. Jack studs, king studs support. Below there are cripple studs. Sill sits on cripple studs.

Blocking or nogging goes in between studs. Prevents studs from bowing or twisting. Prevents fires somewhat. Blocking is on edge in bath and kitchen for tilework.

Stairs used to be totally stringers. Indoor are now mostly prefabed. Get installed like a ramp. Risers and treads vert vs hori.
