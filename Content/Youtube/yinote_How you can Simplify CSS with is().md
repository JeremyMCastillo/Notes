If you are targeting many child elements within a parent element, it can greatly simplify your [[CSS]] since you only have to write your parent element once.

When you have an invalid selector inside an :is() list, only the invalid selector is ignored. If you stack your selectors and you have an invalid selector, the whole rule is ignored by the browser.

Usage: header 
```css
:is(h1, a, .btn) { }
```

Very useful if you're using a compound rule after (ex. p:hover). You can use :is() in the front and reduce repetition. 
```CSS
:is(header, .card) p:hover { }
```

## [7:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flf2vS0IoRs&t=441)

Specificity is determined by the highest level specificity within the :is() statement. You could inadvertently override a rule you mean to use if you have a high specificity element within an earlier :is() statement.
