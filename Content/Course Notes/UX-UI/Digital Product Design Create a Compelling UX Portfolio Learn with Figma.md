# The Purpose of a Portfolio
You want to be able to show what makes you unique. Give a glimpse into your unique background and demonstrate how these things make  you valuable. 
1. Show your work
2. Give a way to contact
3. Just like a programming interview, you'd like the portfolio to show your way of thinking
## Showing Your Thinking
An interesting way to show your unique qualities is to use case studies for applications you may or may not have built. The fact that you have thought through a problem and have designed a product to solve the problem shows a deep level of understanding for technology and problem solving. 
> Show both full implementations for projects and case studies to give a visitor an idea of how you work, and how you problem solve. 

Define the Minimum Viable Product and how they would be implemented. 
Show your hard-copy work with scans or photos of notes or drawings.
