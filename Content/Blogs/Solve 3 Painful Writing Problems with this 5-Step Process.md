# Overview
The biggest issues with [[Blog Writing]]: 
- How to get started? 
- How to cut the fluff? 
- How to finish? 

# Start with the Why
Have an end goal in mind. Usually your end goal is to educate or persuade. 
# Identify Questions
Once you have a goal, think of what is in the way of the goal.
> An unanswered question is a barrier to buying (or learning). 

# Write Heads and Subheads
Start with an outline that addresses the questions you have identified. Writing headings before content helps you discover context before doing too much work. The resulting post ends up more cohesive. 
# Fill in the Blanks
Write lean content by addressing only the question for each subheading. Do not deviate or go on a tangent. 
# Finally, edit
Add more content for clarity, remove content for brevity. Create descriptive language in the final passes.
