# Life Would Be Perfect if We Could Predict the Future
We would make decisions now that would benefit us in the long run. We would set our [[Priorities]] accordingly. 

# Instead of Predicting Priorities, You Can Predict how you _Prioritize_
People rarely change how they prioritize their attention. For example, I want my kids to know me. I want to build things. I want to continue to get better at what I do to build a good life for my family. I can bet that the way I prioritize these things will not change, so I can set my current priorities accordingly, and I will always be working towards a better future. 

# Don't Go Fast, Go Happy
Keep in mind what you are truly working for. It's not about getting things done quickly, it's about getting the right things done.
