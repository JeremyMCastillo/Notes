# Being a hero on a developer team is a sign of organizational issues. 

Example: 
Deployment is coming up but work is not done. A developer stays late and is praised for making the sacrifice. This activity is now encouraged and others are pushed to do the same until it becomes a culture. 

Example: 
One person knows all of the technical details and becomes a linchpin of the organization. They are the hero for knowing things the rest of the team does not, but this creates bottlenecks and dangers for the organization, especially if the hero leaves without recording their knowledge. 

Reduce the need for heroes by making structural changes to encourage peace-time. 
> There are no heroes in peace-time. 
- Discourage staying late by having good scheduling and coding practices. 
- Remove linchpins by documenting well and using simple, non-complex solutions. 
- Praise good practice and simple solutions that everyone can understand.
